ABSTRACT = {The paper considers the problem of algorithmic differentiation of information matrix difference equations for calculating the information matrix derivatives in the information Kalman filter. The equations are presented in the form of a matrix MWGS (modified weighted Gram–Schmidt) transformation. The solution is based on the usage of special methods for the algorithmic differentiation of matrix MWGS transformation of two types: forward (MWGS-LD) and backward (MWGS-UD). The main result of the work is a new MWGS-based array algorithm for computing the information matrix sensitivity equations. The algorithm is robust to machine round-off errors due to the application of the MWGS orthogonalization procedure at each step. The obtained results are applied to solve the problem of parameter identification for state-space models of discrete-time linear stochastic systems. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of the proposed solution.},

ABSTRACT = {This work describes the parameter identification of servo systems using the least squares of orthogonal distances method. The parameter identification problem was reconsidered as data fitting to a plane, which in turn corresponds to a nonlinear minimization problem. Three models of a servo system, having one, two, and three parameters, were experimentally identified using both the classic least squares and the least squares of orthogonal distances. The models with two and three parameters were identified through numerical routines. The servo system model with a single parameter only considered the input gain. In this particular case, the analytical conditions for finding the critical points and for determining the existence of a minimum were presented, and the estimate of the input gain was obtained by solving a simple quadratic equation whose coefficients depended on measured data. The results showed that as opposed to the least squares method, the least squares of orthogonal distances method experimentally produced consistent estimates without regard for the classic persistency-of-excitation condition. Moreover, the parameter estimates of the least squares of orthogonal distances method produced the best tracking performance when they were used to compute a trajectory-tracking controller.},

ABSTRACT = {The study introduces a novel approach to identify potential citation manipulation within academic papers. This method utilizes perturbations of a deep embedding model, integrating Graph-Masked Autoencoders to merge textual information with evidence of graph connectivity. Consequently, it yields a more intricate model of citation distribution. By training a deep network with partial data and reconstructing masked connections, the approach capitalizes on the inherent characteristics of central connections amidst network perturbations. It demonstrates its ability to pinpoint trustworthy citations within the analyzed dataset through comprehensive quantitative evaluations. Additionally, it raises concerns regarding the reliability of specific references, which may be subject to manipulation.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses the problem of parameter identification for discrete-time stochastic systems with unknown exogenous inputs. These systems form an important class of dynamic stochastic system models used to describe objects and processes under a high level of a priori uncertainty, when it is not possible to make any assumptions about the evolution of the unknown input signal or its statistical properties. The main purpose of this paper is to construct a new SVD-based modification of the existing Gillijns and De Moor filtering algorithm for linear discrete-time stochastic systems with unknown exogenous inputs. Using the theoretical results obtained, we demonstrate how this modified algorithm can be applied to solve the problem of parameter identification. The results of our numerical experiments conducted in MATLAB confirm the effectiveness of the SVD-based parameter identification method that was developed, under conditions of unknown exogenous inputs, compared to maximum likelihood parameter identification when exogenous inputs are known.},
